# Site

These sites serve a number of purposes:

1. Provide public information
    1. Landing site
    1. Live demo of Graphters capabilities
    1. Documentation
1. Provide useful tooling (e.g. a functioning config manager, config inference utility, etc...)
1. Serve as possible starter projects and to be used in scaffolding tools in future
1. Provide an organic, on-demand backlog of required functionality

In the medium-term at least these projects will have low test coverage as they don't represent the "core" of the library. Any elements that become useful should be ported to the appropriate core package and full test coverage added at that time.
